# Netflix_in_classifier
Netflix in the past 5-10 years has captured a large populate of viewers.with more viewers,there most likely an increase of show variety. Because of the vast amount of time it would take to gather 1,000 shows one by one, the gathering method took advantage of the Netflixâ€™s suggestion engine. The suggestion engine recommends shows similar to the selected show. As part of this data set, I took 4 videos from 4 ratings (totaling 16 unique shows), then pulled 53 suggested shows per video. The ratings include: G, PG, TV-14, TV-MA. I chose not to pull from every rating (e.g. TV-G, TV-Y, etc.).
